# Triangle of Disease Website

A comprehensive educational website about the Triangle of Disease concept by Daily with Doc & Becca.

## Project Overview

The Triangle of Disease website is designed to educate users about the fundamental biochemical breakdowns that contribute to chronic health challenges. The site explains the three points of the Triangle:

2. **Blood Sugar System** - The fuel system that powers all cellular functions
3. **Adrenal-Thyroid Complex** - The regulatory hub that influences everything from energy production to hormonal balance

The website provides in-depth information, interactive tools, resources, and implementation strategies to help users address health challenges through this comprehensive approach.
